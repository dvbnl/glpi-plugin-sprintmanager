# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- Fixed CSRF token failure on Project Task AJAX dropdown by replacing single-use CSRF check with session login check on the read-only `getprojecttasks.php` endpoint
- Fixed relative include paths to use `dirname(__DIR__, 3)` for Symfony routing compatibility in GLPI 11
- Fixed `Session::checkCSRFToken()` calls replaced with correct `Session::checkCSRF($_POST)`
- Fixed profile rights form posting to dedicated plugin handler instead of GLPI's built-in `profile.form.php` which silently ignored custom rights fields
- Fixed element name for form submit to GLPI

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-03
